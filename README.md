# Token Bazaar
## Overview 🪙
A bazaar with the security and efficiency you deserve to buy/sell your NFT's.
## Features 📃
* List NFTs for easy sale.
* Cancel your NFT listing whenever you want.
* Buy NFTs using Ethereum.
* Modify the percentage of fees you will receive for each sale made in your bazaar.
* Add fraudulent users to a blacklist to prevent them from selling or buying NFTs.
* Remove fraudulent users from the blacklist when the time is right.
* In case of emergency, pause all bazaar transactions to avoid system errors or inappropriate actions by scammers and resume them when necessary.
* All smart contract functions tested.
## Technical details ⚙️
* Framework CLI -> Foundry.
* Forge version -> 1.1.0-stable.
* Solidity compiler version -> 0.8.24.
## Deploying the contract 🛠️
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open Visual Studio Code (you should already have Foundry installed).
3. Select "File" > "Open Folder", select the cloned repository folder.
4. In the project navigation bar, open the "TokenBazaar.sol" file located in the "src" folder.
5. In the toolbar above, select "Terminal" > "New Terminal".
6. Select the "Git bash" terminal (previously installed).
7. Run the `forge build` command to compile the script.
8. In the project navigation bar, open the "TokenBazaar.t.sol" file located in the "test" folder.
9. Run the command `forge test --match-test` followed by the name of a test function to test it and verify the smart contract functions are working correctly. For example, run `forge test --match-test testMintNFT -vvvv` to test the `testMintNFT` function.
10. Run `forge coverage` to generate a code coverage report, which allows you to verify which parts of the "NFTMarketplace.sol" script code (in the "src" folder) are executed by the tests. This helps identify areas outside the coverage that could be exposed to errors/vulnerabilities.
